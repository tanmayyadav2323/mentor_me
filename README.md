<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

MentorMe is a platform that enables mentors (for, e.g. remote employees and fitness dieticians) to monetise their success by allowing students to receive paid mentorship from them.
### How Does It Work?

Suppose someone recently got a 100K USD remote job offer as a software developer, and they don't have enough time to create a video course or mentor every kid.

They can create a paid event (e.g. 180 Days Of Development) on our platform where they will assign tasks to all community members each day along with the resources they followed for the same.

This way is easier for them to provide mentorship at scale, and students get the sure-shot path to achieve the same milestone.
